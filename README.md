## Description

The Age Prediction Model is a machine learning-based application that predicts the age of individuals from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This system can be used by various industries for age verification, personalization of services, and demographic studies.

The workflow involves:
1. Loading a pre-trained CNN model.
2. Accepting user inputs for images containing faces.
3. Preprocessing the input data using OpenCV for face detection.
4. Using the CNN model to predict the age of individuals.
5. Displaying the predicted age to the user.
