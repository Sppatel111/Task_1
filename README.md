# Age Prediction Model

## Overview:
This model predicts the age of individuals from images. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze facial features and estimate the age of the person in the image.

## Task Description:
- Predicts the age of individuals from images.
- Utilizes a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image processing and age estimation.

## Usage:
1. **Input**: Images containing faces of individuals.
2. **Output**: Predicted age of the individuals in the images.
3. **Implementation**: Utilizes machine learning libraries like TensorFlow for model training and inference. Image processing libraries like OpenCV (cv2) are used for face detection and manipulation. A simple CNN model is employed for age estimation. GUI development can be facilitated using Tkinter for user interface.

## Dependencies:
- Python
- Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn)
- Image processing libraries (OpenCV - cv2)
- Data manipulation libraries (NumPy, Pandas)
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib)
- GUI development (Tkinter, filedialog, ttk)
- Operating system interaction (os)
